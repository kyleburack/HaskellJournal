Lmabda Calculus starts with a program of function containing a variable.
λx.e, with e being the function and x being the variable

e::=λx.e|ee|x
x is the range over an infinite set, the elements of x are variables

This is the definition of the functions from higher level programming languages

λx basically equivelates to the definition of the function, what it is and the parameters along with it.

e is basically the rest, the code inside. how the funtion works and the return.

this is the base form for the definition of the function as any values or data can be inputted into the lambda expression created

these rules can be combined with the same rules and create extensive lambda expressions that are tied together to create a longer expression

abc ---> ((ab)c)
abcd ---> (((ab)c)d)
