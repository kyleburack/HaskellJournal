M > D > C > L > X > V > I  
For example, IVIXILICIDIM will reduce to MDCLXVIIIIII.  

For the rewrite rules ytou make it so that if the roman numeral on the right of the 2 roiman numerals you are checking in the rules then swap the positions.

CM->MC
IV->VI

this does not use reduction of values, comes now
simple really,

IIIII->V
VV->x
XXXXX->L
LL->C
CCCCC->D
DD->M

thats the rewrite so that reduction happens when available
becuase of using additive over normal we dont have to have the cases of sebtration of roman numerals to obtain specific values.
