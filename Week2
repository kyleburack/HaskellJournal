How haskell differs.

I believe that the main reason and way that haskell differs from say python is in python (an imperial language) there is a distiguish between statements and expressions.
in imperial statements like conditionals, oops, and assignments of variables. all of these do not return values but rather compute through the
memory flow that python or other imperial languages have.

Haskell is a functional programming language. which means that everything is an expression. The computational model of funxctional languages is simpiler than that of imperial.
Haskell can write a compiler for a imperative language.
