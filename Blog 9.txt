Blog Week 9

Look back on Programming languages

Stuff i liked:
The pacing towards the end. I am a fan of slower pace with more examples and explaining. But needs to still be quick enough to not get repetitive

Hard to get pacing because somethings might be harder to know how the class will react and might understand quicker. 

Office hours, you had tons of office hours available and even thought tha=ey were always in the same tiume as another class, knowing they are there is great
I really enjoyed office hours before tests as a review session, i know its a lot more work for you as you need to make a practice test and also the sloutions for them in addition to the exam in a few days time

Stuff i disliked:
Studying for the midterm i was reviewing all my notes like crazy and examples, but then the midterm was exactly like the midterm, ithink more clarity on that would have been great. 

no videos of the installation of tools needed for success. If we need to download a bunch of stuff that is complex to install it is ideal to have a video example. I know its hard with multiple systems and you dont have a windows machine, but wouldn't chapman be able to provide you with one for learning?

Overall this class was very intresting and i learned a lot. the tests teach me more than anything else really because you come in with some ideas, the test is completely out there and then you understand the material at its base easier.
